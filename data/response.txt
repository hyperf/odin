Thought: The user wants to group the "建店信息表" (Store Information Table) by "大区" (Region).

Action: ModifyViews

Observation: I need to modify the view of the "建店信息表-主表" (Store Information Table - Main Table) to include the "大区" (Region) column in the groups section.

Action:

```json
{
    "action": "modify_views",
    "original_views": [
        {
            "view_type": "table",
            "name": "建店信息表-主表"
        }
    ],
    "new_views": [
        {
            "view_type": "table",
            "table_name": "建店信息表",
            "name": "建店信息表-主表",
            "functions": {
                "filters": [],
                "sorts": [],
                "groups": [
                    {
                        "column": "大区"
                    }
                ]
            },
            "columns": []
        }
    ]
}
```

Thought: The view has been modified to group the "建店信息表" (Store Information Table) by "大区" (Region).

Final Answer: "建店信息表" (Store Information Table) has been grouped by "大区" (Region).
